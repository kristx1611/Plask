The original repository is a private repository made for a course project.
This project lasted throughout the whole semester, approximately March - May 2021.
The base requirement was to make an android application where the user could see the live temperature of different Norwegian beaches.
What I worked on were: Querying weather and water temperature from Meteorologisk Institut, storaging queried data, map location of beaches, distance to beaches, favorite beaches, search and filter of local database and queried data, information about the specific beach, live map and user location and the ui elements to represent these elements.
The application was developed by six students using Kotlin, SQL, XML and Android Studio.
